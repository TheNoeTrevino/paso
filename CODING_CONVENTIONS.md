# Coding Conventions

## Re usability

We encourage code reusability through modular design and the use of libraries.
Whenever possible, avoid duplicating code by creating functions or classes that
can be reused across different parts of the project. 

If code is being duplicated, always extract it into a separate module or
function. 

## DRY

Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a fundamental principle of software development.

We try to follow it whenever possible.

## Components

Since we are making a TUI, we should try to mimic REACT's and Angular reusable
components. If possible, use the bubble tea components. If it is not possible,
extend them.
